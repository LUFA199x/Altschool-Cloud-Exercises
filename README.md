# MY AltSchoolAfrica CloudEngineering Journey

This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge in "Cloud engineering" with AltSchoolAfrica. I started this journey on Fri, 1 Apr, 2022. 

The reason for documenting these Exercises is so that others can take something from it.
